- 🎓 I am a graduate of Johns Hopkins University with a BA in Public Health.  I also recently earned my Frontend Developer Certificate from <a href= "reskillamericans.org">ReSkill Americans<a>
- 🌱 I’m currently building my Front-End software development skills. I am also studying own my own to become a Fullstack Developer. I like to think of myself as a student of life. I am enjoying my coding journey so far and love that there is always something to learn.
- 🤔 I’m looking for all the help I can get with Javascript and React. Any tips on interviewing for my first tech position would be greatly appreciated.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a solo project based around mental health, <a href= "https://cmatth21.github.io/You-Are-Not-Alone-Phase-3-Project/index.html">You Are Not Alone</a> and building my professional portfolio.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a dog mom of one to a 4 year old Bichon Frise named Brix 🐾
